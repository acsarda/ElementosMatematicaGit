% Allan Variance analyzer: This script takes in computed Allan Deviation,
% averaging time (T), along with desired slopes and averaging times of
% interest to extract noise coefficients of interest.
% [sigmasOut,f,h] = AnalyzeAVAR(AD,dt,T,Slopes,Ts,plots,method)
% 
% Outputs:
% sigmasOut: Vector of noise coefficients of interest
% f: figure handles to Allan Deviation and Slope plots 
% h: axis handles to plotted elements
%
% Inputs:
% AD: An Allan deviation vector
% T: The corresponding averaging time vector for Allan deviation
% Slopes: A vector containing Allan deviation slopes of interest
% Ts: The corresponding vector containing averaging times of interest for
% extrapolation. Use NaN for slopes with no averaging time of interest such
% as bias instability.
% plots: 0 for no plots, 1 for plots
% method: 1 for left-to-right slope search, 2 for min distance search
